class Sudoku():

    This class creates sudoku objects which can be used to solve sudokus. 
    A sudoku object can be any size grid, as long as the square root of the size is a whole integer.
    To indicate that a cell in the sudoku grid is empty we use a zero.
    A sudoku object is initialized with an empty grid of a certain size.
